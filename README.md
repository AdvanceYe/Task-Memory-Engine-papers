# DAG-Based Memory Architecture for Structured LLM Agents

This repository contains the original implementation and draft for the paper  
**"Beyond Trees: A DAG Memory Framework for Multi-Task Structured LLM Agents"**,  
submitted to arXiv on **April 15, 2025** (submission ID: `submit/6363031`).

The project introduces a DAG-based structured memory system for LLM agents, designed to overcome limitations in tree-based task tracking models (e.g., TMT in TME).  

All ideas and implementations were created by **Ye Ye (AdvanceYe)** before this date.  
Please cite or contact if you wish to use this framework.

ðŸš§ Ongoing experiments & evaluation coming soon.

This repo serves as a **timeproof of contribution** to the proposed memory structure, prior to potential public release or citation.

## ðŸš« Citation Note

> Please do **not cite** this version as final. A refined and benchmarked version will be released later.
