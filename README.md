# ðŸ§  Beyond Trees: DAG Memory Framework for Multi-Task Structured LLM Agents

This private repository contains a timestamped backup of the DAG-based memory architecture paper submitted to arXiv on **April 15, 2025** (submission ID: 6363031).

## ðŸ“„ Paper Description

This work introduces a Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG) memory architecture for Large Language Model (LLM) agents. It extends tree-based memory by supporting:

- Multi-parent task dependencies  
- Interleaved and concurrent task execution  
- Structured rollback and re-planning  
- Cycle detection and DAG integrity maintenance

The method is evaluated through real-world scenarios including travel planning and cooking tasks.

## ðŸ•’ Timestamp Purpose

This repo serves as a **timeproof of contribution** to the proposed memory structure, prior to potential public release or citation.

> Please do **not cite** this version as final. A refined and benchmarked version will be released later.
